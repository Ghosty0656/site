In this guide, you'll learn how to manage permission nodes in your Hytale plugin.

## The `PermissionsModule` class

The `PermissionsModule` class is responsible for managing permission nodes in your plugin. It provides methods to check, grant and revoke permissions for players.

### Adding Permission Nodes

You need a `Set<String>` containing all the permission nodes you want to add, these are added on top of the already existing permission nodes the user may have, it is not a replacement.

```java
Set<String> permissions = new HashSet<>();
PermissionsModule perms = PermissionsModule.get();
perms.addUserPermission(playerUUID, permissions);
```

### Removing Permission Nodes

Same as above, we just use the `removeUserPermission` method instead to remove permission nodes.

```java
Set<String> permissions = new HashSet<>();
PermissionsModule perms = PermissionsModule.get();
perms.removeUserPermission(playerUUID, permissions);
```

### Check Permission Nodes

To check if a player has a specific permission node, you can use the `hasPermission` method.

```java
PermissionsModule perms = PermissionsModule.get();
boolean hasPermission = perms.hasPermission(playerUUID, "permission.node");
```
